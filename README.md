# Semi-Covid-Evaluation
A project that I decided to look at. The data is from Kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yamqwe/omicron-covid19-variant-daily-cases). The dataset shows some data about different cases of Covid-19 and its different variants. In addition, the location of the country of each case is also represented. With this knowledge I wanted to dive in and do some analysis and evaluation on this data.

The Last 4 figures that are in the code are not showing because the code was made in Google Colab. However, it does show the figures in Google Colab.
